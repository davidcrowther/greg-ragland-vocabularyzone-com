                Vocabulary Training For People Who <br>

            <p class="bigger">
                When it's your turn to make a point, you start off smoothly with a crisp <br> sentence. Not an "uhm" to be heard. Not a single word wasted. You make a few
                <br> more points using strong, precise words.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everybody listens attentively. Your meaning is crystal clear and there is no chance of <br> misunderstanding you. You get on a roll and unlike most people,
                <br>
                the more you talk, the smarter you sound.

            I detest the common idea that having a strong vocabulary is about using long words and academic language.
        </h4>
        <p class="bigger">
            So unlike other vocabulary courses, we don't teach you hundreds of words that you would never use in everyday conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe you already know most of the words you'll ever need. They're stored in your passive vocabulary and all you need to do is move them to your active vocabulary.

                When I was a teenager, I decided I wanted to be an attorney. <br>
                "You need a good vocabulary for that" was the response from my <br> parents and teachers.
            </h4>
            <p class="bigger">
                So I dedicated myself to expanding my vocabulary. I bought books and courses - <br> some helped, some didn't. I studied 100's of executives that had commanding
                <br> vocabularies from the worlds of finance, accounting, marketing and technology.
            </p>
            <p class="highlighted">
                Over the past 15 years, I've developed a method that helps people <br>
                find the right word at the right time.
